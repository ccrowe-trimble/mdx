This is a sample bit of code that is using the following

* React
* Typescript
* Vite
* MDX

Note: No nextJS

This code works both for static and dynamic MDX when running via **NPM RUN DEV**, but if you perform a '**npm run build**' and then '**npm run preview**' it does not work for dynamic MDX. The custom react component causes it to fail.

I do not know how to fix this and would like to find out how to make this work.
